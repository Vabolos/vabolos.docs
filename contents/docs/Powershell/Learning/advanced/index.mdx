# Advanced Scripting Techniques

## Using Script Blocks Effectively
```powershell
$scriptBlock = { Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 10 } }
Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $scriptBlock
```

## Dynamic Parameters
```powershell
function Get-UserInfo {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$Username
    )
    Get-ADUser -Filter {SamAccountName -eq $Username}
}
```

## Using Background Jobs
```powershell
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }
Get-Job | Receive-Job
```

---

# Performance Optimization

## Using Efficient Loops
```powershell
$LargeArray | ForEach-Object -Parallel { $_ * 2 }
```

## Avoiding Unnecessary Object Creation
```powershell
$Processes = Get-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, Id, CPU
```

## Optimizing Pipeline Execution
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq 'Running' | Select-Object Name, DisplayName
```

---

# Security and Hardening

## Execution Policy Management
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Secure Credential Handling
```powershell
$Cred = Get-Credential
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -Credential $Cred -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
```

## Auditing and Logging
```powershell
Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveAtExit
Get-EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 10
```

---

# Custom Modules and Advanced Functions

## Creating Custom Modules
```powershell
New-ModuleManifest -Path "C:\PowerShell\MyModule.psd1"
```

## Using Private Functions in Modules
```powershell
function PrivateFunction {
    Write-Output "This is private"
}
Export-ModuleMember -Function * -Exclude PrivateFunction
```

---

# PowerShell Remoting

## Enabling and Configuring Remoting
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

## Secure Remote Sessions
```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

---

# Working with APIs and Web Services

## Sending API Requests
```powershell
$Response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerShell" -Method GET
$Response | Format-List
```

## Parsing JSON Responses
```powershell
$Data = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $Response
$Data.full_name
```

---

# Debugging and Logging

## Using Debugging Tools
```powershell
Set-PSDebug -Trace 2
```

## Writing Logs to Files
```powershell
"Log entry: $(Get-Date)" | Out-File "C:\Logs\script.log" -Append
```

---

# Best Practices for Advanced Users

## General Guidelines
- Use `Try-Catch-Finally` for robust error handling
- Implement logging in automation scripts
- Secure scripts with least privilege principles
- Optimize scripts for performance and efficiency
