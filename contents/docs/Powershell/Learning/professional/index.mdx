PowerShell is a critical tool for enterprise environments, enabling automation, security enforcement, and infrastructure management. This guide covers professional-level topics to maximize PowerShell's potential in large-scale environments.

## Key Topics Covered
- Enterprise Automation Strategies
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Security Hardening and Compliance
- Advanced Remoting and Parallel Execution
- DevOps and CI/CD Integration
- Working with Databases and APIs
- PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration)
- Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

# Enterprise Automation Strategies

## Automating Active Directory Tasks
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object Name, SamAccountName, Enabled
```

## Automating Software Deployment
```powershell
$Computers = Get-Content "C:\servers.txt"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Computers -ScriptBlock {
    Start-Process msiexec.exe -ArgumentList '/i C:\Path\To\Software.msi /quiet /norestart' -Wait
}
```

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with PowerShell

## Using PowerShell with Terraform
```powershell
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Deploying Azure Resources with PowerShell
```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name MyResourceGroup -Location "EastUS"
```

---

# Security Hardening and Compliance

## Auditing User Permissions
```powershell
Get-ACL "C:\SecureFolder" | Format-List
```

## Enforcing Execution Policies
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

## Checking for Unauthorized Accounts
```powershell
Get-LocalUser | Where-Object { $_.Enabled -eq $true -and $_.LastLogon -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) }
```

---

# Advanced Remoting and Parallel Execution

## Running Commands on Multiple Servers
```powershell
$Servers = Get-Content "C:\Servers.txt"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Servers -ScriptBlock { Get-Service wuauserv }
```

## Using PowerShell Runspaces for Parallel Execution
```powershell
$runspacePool = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1, 5)
$runspacePool.Open()
```

---

# DevOps and CI/CD Integration

## Using PowerShell in GitHub Actions
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run PowerShell Script
        run: .\deploy.ps1
```

## PowerShell in Jenkins Pipelines
```powershell
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                powershell '.\deploy.ps1'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Working with Databases and APIs

## Querying SQL Databases
```powershell
$Conn = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection
$Conn.ConnectionString = "Server=MyServer;Database=MyDB;Integrated Security=True;"
$Conn.Open()
```

## Consuming REST APIs
```powershell
$Response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.example.com/data" -Method GET
$Response | ConvertTo-Json
```

---

# PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration)

## Creating a DSC Configuration
```powershell
Configuration SecureServer {
    Node "Server01" {
        WindowsFeature "IIS" {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name   = "Web-Server"
        }
    }
}
SecureServer -OutputPath "C:\DSC"
Start-DscConfiguration -Path "C:\DSC" -Wait -Verbose
```

---

# Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

## Logging Script Output
```powershell
"Log Entry: $(Get-Date)" | Out-File "C:\Logs\event.log" -Append
```

## Monitoring Event Logs
```powershell
Get-EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 10
```

## Sending Email Alerts
```powershell
Send-MailMessage -To "admin@example.com" -From "alerts@example.com" -Subject "Critical Alert" -Body "Server down!" -SmtpServer "smtp.example.com"
```

- Follow modular scripting principles
- Implement error handling (`Try-Catch-Finally`)
- Use logging and monitoring for all automation scripts
- Secure credentials using `Get-Credential` or Azure Key Vault
- Leverage PowerShell DSC for state management
