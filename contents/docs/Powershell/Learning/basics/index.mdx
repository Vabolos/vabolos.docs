# Introduction to PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language designed for automation and configuration management. Built on .NET, it provides deep system integration, making it a valuable tool for administrators and developers.

## Why Use PowerShell?
- Automates repetitive tasks
- Manages system configurations
- Works with various data formats (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Supports remote administration
- Extensible via modules and scripts

---

# Getting Started

## Installation
PowerShell comes pre-installed on Windows, but newer versions (PowerShell Core) are cross-platform and can be installed on macOS and Linux.

### Check PowerShell Version
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

### Install PowerShell Core
- **Windows**: Download from [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/powershell)
- **Linux/macOS**: Use a package manager (e.g., `brew install powershell` for macOS)

## Running PowerShell
- **Windows**: Open `PowerShell` or `pwsh` for PowerShell Core.
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `pwsh` in a terminal.

# Commands and Syntax

## Cmdlets
PowerShell commands are called **cmdlets** and follow a `Verb-Noun` format.

```powershell
Get-Process   # Retrieves running processes
Stop-Service  # Stops a service
```

### Finding Commands
```powershell
Get-Command -Noun Process
Get-Help Get-Process -Full
```

---

# Variables and Data Types

## Declaring Variables
```powershell
$Name = "PowerShell"
$Number = 10
$IsAdmin = $true
```

## Data Types
```powershell
[String]$Text = "Hello"
[Int]$Age = 30
[Array]$Items = @(1,2,3)
```

---

# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
```powershell
$Sum = 5 + 10
$Multiply = 4 * 3
```

## Comparison Operators
```powershell
$Result = 5 -eq 5    # True
$Check = 10 -gt 5    # True
```

---

# Loops and Conditional Statements

## If-Else
```powershell
if ($Age -ge 18) {
    Write-Output "Adult"
} else {
    Write-Output "Minor"
}
```

## Loops
```powershell
# For Loop
for ($i=0; $i -lt 5; $i++) { Write-Output $i }

# While Loop
$counter = 1
while ($counter -le 3) {
    Write-Output $counter
    $counter++
}
```

---

# Functions and Scripts

## Creating Functions
```powershell
function Greet {
    param ($Name)
    Write-Output "Hello, $Name!"
}
Greet -Name "User"
```

## Running Scripts
Save as `script.ps1`, then execute:
```powershell
.\script.ps1
```

---

# Modules and Packages

## Importing Modules
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
```

## Installing Modules
```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet
```

---

# File System Operations

## Working with Files
```powershell
New-Item -Path "test.txt" -ItemType File
Get-Content "test.txt"
```

## Working with Directories
```powershell
New-Item -Path "C:\Temp" -ItemType Directory
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Temp" -Recurse
```

---

# Working with JSON, XML, and CSV

## JSON
```powershell
$Data = Get-Content "data.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$Data | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "output.json"
```

## XML
```powershell
[xml]$xmlData = Get-Content "data.xml"
$xmlData.DocumentElement.ChildNodes
```

## CSV
```powershell
$csv = Import-Csv "data.csv"
$csv | Export-Csv "output.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

---

# Registry and WMI

## Query Registry
```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion"
```

## Query WMI
```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem
```

---

# Remote Execution

## Running Remote Commands
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }
```

## Entering Remote Sessions
```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01"
```

---

# Error Handling and Debugging

## Try-Catch Blocks
```powershell
try {
    Get-Item "C:\NonExistentFile.txt"
} catch {
    Write-Output "Error: $_"
}
```

## Debugging Scripts
```powershell
Set-PSDebug -Trace 1
```

---

# Best Practices

## General Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow `Verb-Noun` naming convention for functions
- Use comments to improve readability
- Avoid hardcoding values; use parameters instead

## Security Practices
- Avoid running scripts from untrusted sources
- Use `Set-ExecutionPolicy` to control script execution
- Regularly update PowerShell modules
