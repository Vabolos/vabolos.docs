The original page can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.6&WT.mc_id=ps-gethelp).\r\n  </Callout> */}\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\nSets the PowerShell execution policies for Windows computers.\n\n## SYNTAX\n\n### All\n\n```\nSet-ExecutionPolicy [-ExecutionPolicy] <ExecutionPolicy> [[-Scope] <ExecutionPolicyScope>] [-Force]\r\n [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]\n```\n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet changes PowerShell execution policies for Windows computers. For\r\nmore information, see [about\\_Execution\\_Policies](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_Execution_Policies.md).\n\nBeginning in PowerShell 6.0 for non-Windows computers, the default execution policy is\r\n`Unrestricted` and can't be changed. The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet is available, but PowerShell\r\ndisplays a console message that it's not supported.\n\nAn execution policy is part of the PowerShell security strategy. Execution policies determine\r\nwhether you can load configuration files, such as your PowerShell profile, or run scripts. And,\r\nwhether scripts must be digitally signed before they are run.\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet's default scope is `LocalMachine`, which affects everyone who\r\nuses the computer. To change the execution policy for `LocalMachine`, start PowerShell with **Run\r\nas Administrator**.\n\nTo display the execution policies for each scope, use `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`. To see the\r\neffective execution policy for your PowerShell session use `Get-ExecutionPolicy` with no parameters.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n### Example 1: Set an execution policy\n\nThis example shows how to set the execution policy for the local computer.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy -List\n```\n\n```\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       Undefined\r\n  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the\r\n`RemoteSigned` policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value, `LocalMachine`. To\r\nview the execution policy settings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List**\r\nparameter.\n\n### Example 2: Set an execution policy that conflicts with a Group Policy\n\nThis command attempts to set the `LocalMachine` scope's execution policy to `Restricted`.\r\n`LocalMachine` is more restrictive, but isn't the effective policy because it conflicts with a\r\nGroup Policy. The `Restricted` policy is written to the registry hive `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.\n\n```powershell\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope LocalMachine\r\n\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy : PowerShell updated your local preference successfully, but the setting is\r\noverridden by the Group Policy applied to your system. Due to the override, your shell will retain\r\nits current effective execution policy of \"AllSigned\". Contact your Group Policy administrator for\r\nmore information. At line:1 char:20 + Set-ExecutionPolicy <<<< restricted\r\n\r\nPS> Get-ChildItem -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\r\n\r\n    Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\r\n\r\nName                    Property\r\n----                    --------\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell    Path            : C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\r\n                        ExecutionPolicy : Restricted\r\nScriptedDiagnostics     ExecutionPolicy : Unrestricted\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `Restricted`\r\npolicy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value, `LocalMachine`. The\r\n`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter with the `HKLM:` drive to specify registry\r\nlocation.\n\n### Example 3: Apply the execution policy from a remote computer to a local computer\n\nThis command gets the execution policy object from a remote computer and sets the policy on the\r\nlocal computer. `Get-ExecutionPolicy` sends a **Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy** object down\r\nthe pipeline. `Set-ExecutionPolicy` accepts pipeline input and doesn't require the\r\n**ExecutionPolicy** parameter.\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-ExecutionPolicy } | Set-ExecutionPolicy\n```\n\nThe `Invoke-Command` cmdlet is executed at the local computer and sends the **ScriptBlock** to the\r\nremote computer. The **ComputerName** parameter specifies the remote computer, **Server01**. The\r\n**ScriptBlock** parameter runs `Get-ExecutionPolicy` on the remote computer. The\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` object is sent down the pipeline to the `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.\r\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` applies the execution policy to the local computer's default scope,\r\n`LocalMachine`.\n\n### Example 4: Set the scope for an execution policy\n\nThis example shows how to set an execution policy for a specified scope, `CurrentUser`. The\r\n`CurrentUser` scope only affects the user who sets this scope.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope CurrentUser\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy -List\n```\n\n```\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       Undefined\r\n  CurrentUser       AllSigned\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `AllSigned` policy.\r\nThe **Scope** parameter specifies the `CurrentUser`. To view the execution policy settings, use the\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\nThe effective execution policy for the user becomes `AllSigned`.\n\n### Example 5: Remove the execution policy for the current user\n\nThis example shows how use the `Undefined` execution policy to remove an execution policy for a\r\nspecified scope.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope CurrentUser\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy -List\n```\n\n```\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       Undefined\r\n  CurrentUser       Undefined\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `Undefined` policy. The\r\n**Scope** parameter specifies the `CurrentUser`. To view the execution policy settings, use the\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\n### Example 6: Set the execution policy for the current PowerShell session\n\nThe `Process` scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in\r\nthe environment variable `$Env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference` and is deleted when the session is\r\nclosed.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope Process\n```\n\n```\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       AllSigned\r\n  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `AllSigned`\r\npolicy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the value `Process`. To view the execution policy\r\nsettings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\n### Example 7: Unblock a script to run it without changing the execution policy\n\nThis example shows how the `RemoteSigned` execution policy prevents you from running unsigned\r\nscripts.\n\nA best practice is to read the script's code and verify it's safe *before* using the `Unblock-File`\r\ncmdlet. The `Unblock-File` cmdlet unblocks scripts so they can run, but doesn't change the execution\r\npolicy.\n\n```powershell\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\r\n\r\nPS> Get-ExecutionPolicy\r\n\r\nRemoteSigned\r\n\r\nPS> .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\n.\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded.\r\nThe file .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed.\r\nThe script will not execute on the system.\r\nFor more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess\r\n\r\nPS> Unblock-File -Path .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\nPS> Get-ExecutionPolicy\r\n\r\nRemoteSigned\r\n\r\nPS> .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\nTask 1:\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `RemoteSigned`\r\npolicy. The policy is set for the default scope, `LocalMachine`.\n\nThe `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet shows that `RemoteSigned` is the effective execution policy for\r\nthe current PowerShell session.\n\nThe `Start-ActivityTracker.ps1` script is executed from the current directory. The script is blocked\r\nby `RemoteSigned` because the script isn't digitally signed.\n\nFor this example, the script's code was reviewed and verified as safe to run. The `Unblock-File`\r\ncmdlet uses the **Path** parameter to unblock the script.\n\nTo verify that `Unblock-File` didn't change the execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` displays the\r\neffective execution policy, `RemoteSigned`.\n\nThe script, `Start-ActivityTracker.ps1` is executed from the current directory. The script begins to\r\nrun because it was unblocked by the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.\n\n## PARAMETERS\n\n### -ExecutionPolicy\n\nSpecifies the execution policy. If there are no Group Policies and each scope's execution policy is\r\nset to `Undefined`, then `Restricted` becomes the effective policy for all users.\n\nThe acceptable execution policy values are as follows:\n\n* `AllSigned`. Requires that all scripts and configuration files are signed by a trusted publisher,\r\n  including scripts written on the local computer.\n* `Bypass`. Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.\n* `Default`. Sets the default execution policy. `Restricted` for Windows clients or `RemoteSigned`\r\n  for Windows servers.\n* `RemoteSigned`. Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet\r\n  are signed by a trusted publisher. The default execution policy for Windows server computers.\n* `Restricted`. Doesn't load configuration files or run scripts. The default execution policy for\r\n  Windows client computers.\n* `Undefined`. No execution policy is set for the scope. Removes an assigned execution policy from\r\n  a scope that is not set by a Group Policy. If the execution policy in all scopes is `Undefined`,\r\n  the effective execution policy is `Restricted`.\n* `Unrestricted`. Beginning in PowerShell 6.0, this is the default execution policy for\r\n  non-Windows computers and can't be changed. Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If\r\n  you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the internet, you're prompted for permission\r\n  before it runs.\n\n```yaml\nType: Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\nAccepted values: AllSigned, Bypass, Default, RemoteSigned, Restricted, Undefined, Unrestricted\r\n\r\nRequired: True\r\nPosition: 0\r\nDefault value: None\r\nAccept pipeline input: True (ByValue)\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Force\n\nSuppresses all the confirmation prompts. Use caution with this parameter to avoid unexpected\r\nresults.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Scope\n\nSpecifies the scope that is affected by an execution policy. The default scope is `LocalMachine`.\n\nThe effective execution policy is determined by the order of precedence as follows:\n\n* `MachinePolicy` - Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer\n* `UserPolicy` - Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer\n* `Process` - Affects only the current PowerShell session\n* `LocalMachine` - Default scope that affects all users of the computer\n* `CurrentUser` - Affects only the current user\n\nThe `Process` scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in\r\nthe environment variable `$Env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference`, rather than the registry. When the\r\nPowerShell session is closed, the variable and value are deleted.\n\nExecution policies for the `CurrentUser` scope are written to the registry hive `HKEY_LOCAL_USER`.\n\nExecution policies for the `LocalMachine` scope are written to the registry hive\r\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.\n\n```yaml\nType: Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicyScope\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\nAccepted values: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, MachinePolicy, Process, UserPolicy\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: 1\r\nDefault value: LocalMachine\r\nAccept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Confirm\n\nPrompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases: cf\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -WhatIf\n\nShows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases: wi\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### CommonParameters\n\nThis cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,\r\n-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,\r\n-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see\r\n[about\\_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).\n\n## INPUTS\n\n### Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy\n\nYou can pipe an execution policy object to this cmdlet.\n\n### System.String\n\nYou can pipe a string that contains the name of an execution policy to this cmdlet.\n\n## OUTPUTS\n\n### None\n\nThis cmdlet returns no output.\n\n## NOTES\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't change the `MachinePolicy` and `UserPolicy` scopes because they are\r\nset by Group Policies.\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't override a Group Policy, even if the user preference is more\r\nrestrictive than the policy.\n\nIf the Group Policy **Turn on Script Execution** is enabled for the computer or user, the user\r\npreference is saved, but it's not effective. PowerShell displays a message that explains the\r\nconflict.\n\n## RELATED LINKS\n\n[about\\_Execution\\_Policies](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Execution_Policies.md)\n\n[about\\_Group\\_Policy\\_Settings](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Group_Policy_Settings.md)\n\n[about\\_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md)\n\n[Get-AuthenticodeSignature](Get-AuthenticodeSignature.md)\n\n[Get-ChildItem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)\n\n[Get-ExecutionPolicy](Get-ExecutionPolicy.md)\n\n[Invoke-Command](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Invoke-Command.md)\n\n[Set-AuthenticodeSignature](Set-AuthenticodeSignature.md)\n\n[Unblock-File](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Unblock-File.md)\n"

The\r\n`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter with the `HKLM:` drive to specify registry\r\nlocation.\n\n### Example 3: Apply the execution policy from a remote computer to a local computer\n\nThis command gets the execution policy object from a remote computer and sets the policy on the\r\nlocal computer. `Get-ExecutionPolicy` sends a **Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy** object down\r\nthe pipeline. `Set-ExecutionPolicy` accepts pipeline input and doesn't require the\r\n**ExecutionPolicy** parameter.\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-ExecutionPolicy } | Set-ExecutionPolicy\n```\n\nThe `Invoke-Command` cmdlet is executed at the local computer and sends the **ScriptBlock** to the\r\nremote computer. The **ComputerName** parameter specifies the remote computer, **Server01**. The\r\n**ScriptBlock** parameter runs `Get-ExecutionPolicy` on the remote computer. The\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` object is sent down the pipeline to the `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.\r\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` applies the execution policy to the local computer's default scope,\r\n`LocalMachine`.\n\n### Example 4: Set the scope for an execution policy\n\nThis example shows how to set an execution policy for a specified scope, `CurrentUser`. The\r\n`CurrentUser` scope only affects the user who sets this scope.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope CurrentUser\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy -List\n```\n\n```Output\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       Undefined\r\n  CurrentUser       AllSigned\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `AllSigned` policy.\r\nThe **Scope** parameter specifies the `CurrentUser`. To view the execution policy settings, use the\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\nThe effective execution policy for the user becomes `AllSigned`.\n\n### Example 5: Remove the execution policy for the current user\n\nThis example shows how use the `Undefined` execution policy to remove an execution policy for a\r\nspecified scope.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope CurrentUser\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy -List\n```\n\n```Output\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       Undefined\r\n  CurrentUser       Undefined\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `Undefined` policy. The\r\n**Scope** parameter specifies the `CurrentUser`. To view the execution policy settings, use the\r\n`Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\n### Example 6: Set the execution policy for the current PowerShell session\n\nThe `Process` scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in\r\nthe environment variable `$Env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference` and is deleted when the session is\r\nclosed.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope Process\n```\n\n```Output\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\r\n        ----- ---------------\r\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\r\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\r\n      Process       AllSigned\r\n  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned\r\n LocalMachine    RemoteSigned\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `AllSigned`\r\npolicy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the value `Process`. To view the execution policy\r\nsettings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.\n\n### Example 7: Unblock a script to run it without changing the execution policy\n\nThis example shows how the `RemoteSigned` execution policy prevents you from running unsigned\r\nscripts.\n\nA best practice is to read the script's code and verify it's safe *before* using the `Unblock-File`\r\ncmdlet. The `Unblock-File` cmdlet unblocks scripts so they can run, but doesn't change the execution\r\npolicy.\n\n```powershell\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\r\n\r\nPS> Get-ExecutionPolicy\r\n\r\nRemoteSigned\r\n\r\nPS> .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\n.\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded.\r\nThe file .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed.\r\nThe script will not execute on the system.\r\nFor more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess\r\n\r\nPS> Unblock-File -Path .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\nPS> Get-ExecutionPolicy\r\n\r\nRemoteSigned\r\n\r\nPS> .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1\r\n\r\nTask 1:\n```\n\nThe `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the `RemoteSigned`\r\npolicy. The policy is set for the default scope, `LocalMachine`.\n\nThe `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet shows that `RemoteSigned` is the effective execution policy for\r\nthe current PowerShell session.\n\nThe `Start-ActivityTracker.ps1` script is executed from the current directory. The script is blocked\r\nby `RemoteSigned` because the script isn't digitally signed.\n\nFor this example, the script's code was reviewed and verified as safe to run. The `Unblock-File`\r\ncmdlet uses the **Path** parameter to unblock the script.\n\nTo verify that `Unblock-File` didn't change the execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` displays the\r\neffective execution policy, `RemoteSigned`.\n\nThe script, `Start-ActivityTracker.ps1` is executed from the current directory. The script begins to\r\nrun because it was unblocked by the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.\n\n## PARAMETERS\n\n### -ExecutionPolicy\n\nSpecifies the execution policy. If there are no Group Policies and each scope's execution policy is\r\nset to `Undefined`, then `Restricted` becomes the effective policy for all users.\n\nThe acceptable execution policy values are as follows:\n\n* `AllSigned`. Requires that all scripts and configuration files are signed by a trusted publisher,\r\n  including scripts written on the local computer.\n* `Bypass`. Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.\n* `Default`. Sets the default execution policy. `Restricted` for Windows clients or `RemoteSigned`\r\n  for Windows servers.\n* `RemoteSigned`. Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet\r\n  are signed by a trusted publisher. The default execution policy for Windows server computers.\n* `Restricted`. Doesn't load configuration files or run scripts. The default execution policy for\r\n  Windows client computers.\n* `Undefined`. No execution policy is set for the scope. Removes an assigned execution policy from\r\n  a scope that is not set by a Group Policy. If the execution policy in all scopes is `Undefined`,\r\n  the effective execution policy is `Restricted`.\n* `Unrestricted`. Beginning in PowerShell 6.0, this is the default execution policy for\r\n  non-Windows computers and can't be changed. Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If\r\n  you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the internet, you're prompted for permission\r\n  before it runs.\n\n```yaml\nType: Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\nAccepted values: AllSigned, Bypass, Default, RemoteSigned, Restricted, Undefined, Unrestricted\r\n\r\nRequired: True\r\nPosition: 0\r\nDefault value: None\r\nAccept pipeline input: True (ByValue)\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Force\n\nSuppresses all the confirmation prompts. Use caution with this parameter to avoid unexpected\r\nresults.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Scope\n\nSpecifies the scope that is affected by an execution policy. The default scope is `LocalMachine`.\n\nThe effective execution policy is determined by the order of precedence as follows:\n\n* `MachinePolicy` - Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer\n* `UserPolicy` - Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer\n* `Process` - Affects only the current PowerShell session\n* `LocalMachine` - Default scope that affects all users of the computer\n* `CurrentUser` - Affects only the current user\n\nThe `Process` scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in\r\nthe environment variable `$Env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference`, rather than the registry. When the\r\nPowerShell session is closed, the variable and value are deleted.\n\nExecution policies for the `CurrentUser` scope are written to the registry hive `HKEY_LOCAL_USER`.\n\nExecution policies for the `LocalMachine` scope are written to the registry hive\r\n`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.\n\n```yaml\nType: Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicyScope\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases:\r\nAccepted values: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, MachinePolicy, Process, UserPolicy\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: 1\r\nDefault value: LocalMachine\r\nAccept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -Confirm\n\nPrompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases: cf\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### -WhatIf\n\nShows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.\n\n```yaml\nType: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter\r\nParameter Sets: (All)\r\nAliases: wi\r\n\r\nRequired: False\r\nPosition: Named\r\nDefault value: False\r\nAccept pipeline input: False\r\nAccept wildcard characters: False\n```\n\n### CommonParameters\n\nThis cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,\r\n-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,\r\n-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see\r\n[about\\_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).\n\n## INPUTS\n\n### Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy\n\nYou can pipe an execution policy object to this cmdlet.\n\n### System.String\n\nYou can pipe a string that contains the name of an execution policy to this cmdlet.\n\n## OUTPUTS\n\n### None\n\nThis cmdlet returns no output.\n\n## NOTES\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't change the `MachinePolicy` and `UserPolicy` scopes because they are\r\nset by Group Policies.\n\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't override a Group Policy, even if the user preference is more\r\nrestrictive than the policy.\n\nIf the Group Policy **Turn on Script Execution** is enabled for the computer or user, the user\r\npreference is saved, but it's not effective. PowerShell displays a message that explains the\r\nconflict.\n\n## RELATED LINKS\n\n[about\\_Execution\\_Policies](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Execution_Policies.md)\n\n[about\\_Group\\_Policy\\_Settings](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Group_Policy_Settings.md)\n\n[about\\_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md)\n\n[Get-AuthenticodeSignature](Get-AuthenticodeSignature.md)\n\n[Get-ChildItem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)\n\n[Get-ExecutionPolicy](Get-ExecutionPolicy.md)\n\n[Invoke-Command](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Invoke-Command.md)\n\n[Set-AuthenticodeSignature](Set-AuthenticodeSignature.md)\n\n[Unblock-File](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Unblock-File.md)\n"

    "content": "import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';\n\n# PowerShell Sandboxing\n\n## Introduction\n\nSandboxing in PowerShell helps developers and administrators separate development environments from production environments, reducing the risk of unintended changes or security issues.\n\n<Callout>\n  **Key Benefits:** Isolation of environments, controlled execution, and safer deployment.\n</Callout>\n\n## Separating Development and Production Environments\n\n### 1. **Using PowerShell Execution Policies**\n\nRestrict script execution to prevent untrusted scripts from running in production.\n\n```powershell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n```\n\n### 2. **Creating a Dedicated Development Environment**\n\nUse PowerShell profiles to define different environments.\n\n```powershell\n# Development Profile\r\n$env:PSModulePath = \"C:\\DevModules;\" + $env:PSModulePath\n```\n\n```powershell\n# Production Profile\r\n$env:PSModulePath = \"C:\\ProdModules;\" + $env:PSModulePath\n```\n\n### 3. **Using Windows Sandbox for Safe Testing**\n\nWindows Sandbox provides an isolated environment to test scripts.\n\n#### Enabling Windows Sandbox:\n\n```powershell\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName \"Containers-DisposableClientVM\" -Online -NoRestart\n```\n\n#### Running PowerShell Scripts in Sandbox:\n\n1. Open **Windows Sandbox**.\n2. Copy and execute scripts without affecting the host machine.\n\n## Managing Configurations and Dependencies\n\n### 1. **Using PowerShell Modules for Environment Separation**\n\nStore development and production modules separately.\n\n```powershell\nImport-Module \"C:\\DevModules\\MyModule.psm1\"  # Development\r\nImport-Module \"C:\\ProdModules\\MyModule.psm1\"  # Production\n```\n\n### 2. **Using Virtual Environments with PowerShell Core**\n\nPowerShell Core allows using separate environments with different module sets.\n\n```powershell\n$env:PSModulePath = \"C:\\Users\\User\\DevEnv\\Modules;\" + $env:PSModulePath\n```\n\n## Deploying Scripts to Production\n\n### 1. **Using Git for Version Control**\n\nKeep track of changes and ensure a stable production version.\n\n```powershell\n# Commit and push changes\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"Updated script\"\r\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 2. **Using PowerShell Remoting for Deployment**\n\nDeploy scripts to remote production servers securely.\n\n```powershell\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName ProdServer -FilePath \"C:\\Scripts\\Deploy.ps1\"\n```\n\n### 3. **Using CI/CD Pipelines for Automated Deployment**\n\nLeverage tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.\n\n#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow:\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy PowerShell Script\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - main\r\njobs:\r\n  deploy:\r\n    runs-on: windows-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Checkout Repository\r\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\r\n      - name: Run PowerShell Script\r\n        run: pwsh -File Deploy.ps1\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing sandboxing techniques in PowerShell ensures safer script execution, maintains environment separation, and facilitates controlled deployments. By leveraging execution policies, Windows Sandbox, and deployment automation, administrators can confidently manage PowerShell environments.\n\n***\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n* [PowerShell Execution Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/execution-policy)\n* [Windows Sandbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview)\n* [GitHub Actions for PowerShell](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)\n"
